Read carefully this [site](https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling) and finish the tutorial to undertand this vulnerability. This kind of attack is very tricky to understand, but is totally awesome when you finally see it in action.

If you still feel lost you can peek into the `SOLUTION.md` file in each of the labs - if you find another path to the solution send me aand tell me how you achieved it.

* First at all: The technique behind HTTP request smuggling
* Stop using a Proxy as alternative to a Firewall and/or WAF - use it as an additional perimeter
* Don't trust your network blindly! Zero-Trust is hard to achieve but worth to iterate at it as an inspiration
